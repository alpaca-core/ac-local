# Proof of Concept Targets

This directory contains experimental and proof of concept (PoC) targets. They are only built when the project is configured from its root directory.

## Personal Sandbox

You can create a personal sandbox which is not tracked by git. Just add a subdirectory named `personal-sandbox` and CMake will automatically add it.
