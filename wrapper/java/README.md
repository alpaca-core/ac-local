# Alpaca Core SDK Java Wrapper

Since we want to be good open source citizens, we conform to Java and gradle's ridiculous directory structure conventions.

* `jni.hpp` - a third party library which wraps JNI for C++
* `ac-jni` - our JNI wrapper
* `ac` - com.alpacacore java library
* `test` - tests and test utl java library
