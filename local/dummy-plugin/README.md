# Dummy Inference Plugin

A dummy inference library and plugin which does some silly ops instead of AI inference.

It provides interface and API integration without the computational costs associated with a "real" inference library.

Use for in-repo tests and examples.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Do not use as a blueprint for your own inference plugins. 
> Use [ilib-foo](https://github.com/alpaca-core/ilib-foo) instead.
