# Dummy Inference

A dummy inference library which does some silly ops instead of AI inference.

It provides interface and API integration without the computational costs associated with a "real" inference library.

## Uses

* Blueprint for adding real inference libraries
* API and provider tests and examples
* SDK wrapper tests
