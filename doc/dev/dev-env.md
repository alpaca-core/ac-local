# Developer Environments

## Linux

### Ubuntu

We use Ubuntu 24.04, but the setup will likely work for other versions as well.

### Arch Linux

We use Manjaro so some packages might have different names in pure AUR Arch Linux.

### Visual Studio Code Setup

## Windows

We use Windows 11, but the setup will likely work for Windows 10 as well.

Install the following software (we recommend using Chocolatey, Scoop, or WinGet, but manually is also fine):

### Visual Studio Code Setup

Install:

* [VS code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/windows)
