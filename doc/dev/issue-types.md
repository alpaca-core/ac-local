# Issue Types

## Main

Main issues are big tasks, which involve multiple sub-issues. A main issue must have a related project to track its sub-issues. The set of main issues is a higher-level view of the project. A main issue may contain sub-issues which are main issues themselves.

The person assigned to a main issue is not necessarily the one who implements it, but the one who is responsible for it moving forward. The person is the product owner of the task.

## Pioneer 

Implementing the first from a whole class of features is done through pioneer issues. It is more loosely defined and is used to pave the way for the rest of the features of this class. RnD, software architecture, and design are all implied parts of such a task.
